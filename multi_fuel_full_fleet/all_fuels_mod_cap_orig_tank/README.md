# Multi-fuel simulation with modified cargo capacities

* No regulation
* cargo capacities are modified to account for changes in tank size due to different mass and energy density, engine efficiency, and boil-off. However, the tank sizes themselves are kept the same to control for increased tank CAPEX And OPEX.
